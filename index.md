# This is my README file for Programming in 2022-23 year of High School
#### For Semester 1, you will need to download processing from a website called Processing.org
#### For Semester 2, you will need to use a website called Replit.com.


# Semester 1 - Made in Java

#### History of Computers
This is my first ever project that I worked on and I think it's pretty cool

#### SpaceGame
This game I made is a rip off of Asteroids and it's pretty intense with code

#### Calculator
This is also pretty intense with code but it was fun to make and actually works

#### Etch-A-Sketch
This is pretty fun but you have to make a new line everytime you want to draw something
