## Hello, My name is Liam Scott and this is my Programming README file for all my projects in 2022-23 year of High School. You need Processing for all of Semester 1.


## Semester 1

### History of Computers
This is my first ever project that I worked on and I think it's pretty cool

### SpaceGame
This game I made is a rip off of Asteroids and it's pretty intense with code
![SpaceGame](https://github.com/LemScoot/Skyline-high-Programming-2022-23/tree/main/src/SpaceGame)

### Calculator
This is also pretty intense with code but it was fun to make and actually works

### Etch-A-Sketch
This is pretty fun but you have to make a new line everytime you want to draw something

### Convertors
This I can make a lot of. It's really easy. to make another clone of it

### ScreenSaver
You can make this your screensaver if you want. It looks like the pipes screensaver from Windows 98

### Grades
This is a timeline type app. You can drag your mouse across the line and the grade will update when you drag your mouse across the screen
